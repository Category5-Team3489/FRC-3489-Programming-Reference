- Go over robot basics:
    - Types of motors
    - Limelight
    - Navx
    - Limit switches
    - Lights - Blinkin
    - Encoders
    - Solenoids
    - Robot signal light
    
- Basic mechanical stuff:
    - Gearboxes
    - Gear reductions
    - Pnuematics

- Robot control technology:
     - Shuffleboard
     - Driver Station
     - Network tables
     - Doing robot simulations through VS code

- Robot drivetrain types:
    - Tank drive
    - Swerve drive

- What makes up a subsystem?
- Difference between teleop and auto, robot modes.
- Explain VS code, what is its purpose?
    - How to deploy/build code, what is the difference?
    - Shortcuts Alt+Shift+F5 to deploy
